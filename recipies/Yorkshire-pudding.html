    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A yummy and traditional addition to the holiday feast. If you intend to make this, the timing has to be juuuuust right.</p>
    <P>I would suggest preparing the mixture the evening before, and having it ready while the roast beef is cooking.</P>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef drippings</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Mix flour and salt together until blended. Make a well in the flour, add the milk, and</p>
            <p>whisk until consistent. Beat the eggs into the batter. Add water and beat again until</p>
            <p>the mixture is light and frothy. Set aside for an hour (or, if it's the day before, cover</p>
            <p>in the fridge overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If the batter has been refrigerated, allow it to come up to room temperature before using</p>
            <p>When the roast beef is ready to come out of the oven, ready the mixture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour off drippings from roast beef and measure out desired amount (about 1/2 cup should do).</p>
            <p>Pour drippings into a 9x12 inch baking dish and place into the oven until the drippings sizzle.</p>
            <p>Pour the batter over the drippings and bake for 30 minutes (or until the sides have risen and</p>
            <p>are golden brown).Cut into eight portions and serve immediately.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
