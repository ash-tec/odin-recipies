    <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F43%2F2017%2F07%2FIMG_9261-Banana-Milk-Coffee-Photo-by-Vanessa-Greaves-resized.jpg" alt="sous vide cold brew coffee">
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This method mimics the traditional time-consuming method of making cold-brew coffee in the fridge, but in 2 hours instead of 24!</p>
    <p>The warm water temperature is kept low enough to speed up the cold-brew process, but not hot enough to release the bitter, acidic</p>
    <p>flavors you get from hot-brewed drip coffee. The result is a super smooth brew that you'll want to make again and again. Use your</p>
    <p>favorite fresh-ground coffee for best results.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 cup coarsley ground coffee
        </li>
        <li>4(16 ounce) Mason jars</li>
        <li>8 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Place 1/4 cup coffee grounds into each jar, then top with water. Screw on the lids until just barely tightened; do not overtighten.</p></li>
        <li>    
            <p>Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the jars completely and place a sous vide immersion cooker into the water. Set temperature</p>
            <p>to 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) according to manufacturer's directions.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p>Submerge mason jars into the water bath and set timer for 2 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remove jars to a cooling rack and let cool until easily handled. Strain the mixture through a coffee filter to stop the steeping process.</p>
            <p>Pour over ice and serve, or return to rinsed-out jars and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
